# Slime Racer [Name TBD]

This is a 2D Unity project. Players will breed and train slimes to race on various courses.

There will be singleplayer races and multiplayer, allowing players to play with friends through a lobby system or play random matches.

There will be a level editor for players to make their own courses and upload them to be played by others.

## How It Works

Currently, basic slime movement is added. There is a two-camera setup, the main camera follows the leader (but will eventually follow the player's slime), and the overlayed camera shows the entire level and the positions of each slime.
